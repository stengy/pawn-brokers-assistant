Had some family things to take care of so off to a little later start than initially desired.  Going to take most of today/night and stacktrace & get familiar with what the code is doing.  I'm thinkin that I am wanting to tackle getting the firearm fee functionality working first, then move to the missed ticket.  Will see once I'm farther in.
